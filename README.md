# NLP-project-1

## About the project
This is my first project in the domain of NLP. With this project, I aim to get familiar with the packages that are used to create such a model. This project also helped me get familiar with some techniques that are used to create such a model. 

In this project, I have created a model which predicts emotions from the text that is given. I have used **streamlit** to implement this model on a website.

The website could be accessed locally by running app.py in the App folder.
